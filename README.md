🚀 Getting Hands-On with Cloud Storage on Azure! ☁️

📚 What I learned: I worked on a cloud storage solution for securely storing data on Azure. A small business wanted to store employee data safely in the cloud, and I walked through the steps to make that happen.

Here’s what I did in this lab:
✅ Set up Azure: I started by creating a free Azure account to get familiar with the platform.
✅ Created Storage Resources: I set up a storage account and container to hold the data.
✅ Uploaded Data: I uploaded a set of employee records in CSV format to the storage container.
✅ Configured Access Control: I used Azure IAM to assign Read-Only permissions, so the right people can view the data but can’t make changes.

💡 Outcome: I successfully uploaded and secured the data, making sure only authorized users have the appropriate access.

🎯 Skills Gained:

Working with Azure storage services.
Configuring security settings for cloud data.
Using IAM to control access, including Read-Only roles.
